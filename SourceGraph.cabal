Name:                SourceGraph
Version:             0.7.0.7
Synopsis:            Static code analysis using graph-theoretic techniques.
Description: {
Statically analyse Haskell source code using graph-theoretic
techniques.  Sample reports can be found at:
<http://code.haskell.org/~ivanm/Sample_SourceGraph/SampleReports.html>
.
To use SourceGraph, call it as either:
.
> SourceGraph path/to/Foo.cabal
.
Or, if your project doesn't use Cabal, then there is limited support
for using an overall module from your program\/library:
.
> SourceGraph path/to/Foo.hs
.
Note that the Cabal method is preferred, as it is better able to
determine the project name and exported modules (when passing a
Haskell file to SourceGraph, it uses that module's name as the overall
name of project and assumes that it is the only exported module; as
such, it works better for programs than libraries).
.
Whichever way you run SourceGraph, it then creates a @SourceGraph@
subdirectory in the same directory as the file that was passed to it,
and within that subdirectory creates the analysis report in
@Foo.html@.
.
SourceGraph is still experimental in terms of its ability to parse and
properly understand Haskell source code and in the types of analyses
it performs.
